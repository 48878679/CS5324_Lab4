    "We chose a customer segmentation dataset with 8,068 entries. It includes details about customers, such as their gender, age, marital status, education, job, work experience, spending habits, and family size. The goal is to predict which of four customer groups (A, B, C, or D) a customer belongs to based on their information. This dataset would be helpful for businesses to understand their customers and target audience better. Additionally, companies can use the results to send personalized offers, improve customer service, and make better marketing plans. This model would be deployed mostly for online-use because it's important for companies to keep up with the trends and preferences of their target audience and general customers to make the right choices in marketing and keep up sales.
